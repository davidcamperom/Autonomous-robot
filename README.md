# Autonomous robot using MATLAB
:octocat: David Campero Ma√±a  

This project consists of the development of an autonomous robot that takes dishes from the kitchen of a restaurant to the customer's table and returns to its starting point.

:bulb: There is, at the moment, 1 Spanish PDF report which is the one which explain the entire project and all stages of development. 
Soon, I will upload an English version, soon. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Read the README inside "Autonomous robot" folder for the correct execution of the project.
Thanks! :)
